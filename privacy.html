        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>Effective date: 12 March 2019</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy concerns your use of the mobile application (app) BirdCal for iOS devices, version 10.0 or later, and follows guidelines published by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.</p>
        
        <h4>Who we are and how to contact us</h4>
        
        <p>BirdCal was built by igfconsultancies.net, a not-for-profit association that fosters sustainable development and accelerated capacity building. Privacy concerns should be sent to <a href="mailto:igfconsultancies@gmail.com">igfconsultancies@gmail.com</a></p>
        
        
        <h4>What kind of personal information does BirdCal collect and store?</h4>
        <p>If access is granted, BirdCal can annotate your journal records with photos and locality/placemarks. In addition Apple Inc. may collect analytics, diagnostic, and usage information anonymously. These data are not required but can enhance the app and guide future app development.</p>
        
        <h4>How does BirdCal collect personal information, and where it will be stored?</h4>
        <p>Personal information may be entered into your own journal entries with annotations&ndash;photo, category and locality. Any such entries are stored locally and are the property of the Users. </p>
        
        <h4>Why does BirdCal collect personal information?</h4>
        <p> Your journal documents your discoveries and enlightenment. The records reflect your interests and species diversity as well as bird populations at different localities.</p>
  
        <h4>How will personal information be used and disclosed?</h4>
        <p> Users are encouraged to share their sightings with some caveates (see <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>). In fact, accelerated capacity building depends on sharing, improving your recognition/communication skills and introducing others to the joys of birding. You may also consider sharing information with overarching projects like Wikipedia and eBird. However, those decisions rest with you.</p>

        <h4>How can you access your personal information, and correct it?</h4>
        <p> You may edited or deleted BirdCal journal records. Under &quot;Your Sightings&quot; tap a record to display a detail view, tap &quot;Edit&quot; then &quot;Delete&quot;.</p>

  
        <h4>How do you complain about a breach of the Australian Privacy Principles?</h4>
        <p>In the unlikely event of a BirdCal privacy breach, Users&apos; should notify <a href="mailto:igfconsultancies@gmail.com">igfconsultancies@gmail.com</a>. In general, privacy issues are dealt with during the app&apos;s development process. Alternativly, you can refer complaints to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner <a href="mailto:enquiries@oaic.gov.au">enquiries@oaic.gov.au</a>.</p>
        
        <h4>Is Users&apos; private information disclosed outside Australia</h4>
        <p> BirdCal neither sells private information nor rents, exchanges, communicates to 3rd parties or &quot;finger&ndash;prints&quot; data for tracking purposes. However, Apple Inc. may collect BirdCal analytics, diagnostic, and usage information anonymously using servers outside Australia. To disable this feature, tap &quot;Settings&quot; &quot;Privacy&quot; &quot;Analytics&quot; &quot;Share Analytics&quot; and toggle the button off.</p>
        
        <h4>How can you minimize data breaches and their impact?</h4>
        <p>As with all internet technologies, vulnerabilities exist and may be exploited by the unscrupulous. Follow best practices for securing your mobile device. In the case of BirdCal, sensitive information is not required and, in some cases, should be omitted (see <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>).</p>

<article id="Food and environmental security">

<h2>Catchment management</h2>

<p>The Millennium Declaration improved the lives hundreds of millions of people around the world and defined indicators to gauge progress. However, disasters, food and economic crises have eroded gains and prompted a call for economic growth that benefits all while protecting ecosystems that sustain life (<a href="http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/(2011_E)%20MDG%20Report%202011_Book%20LR.pdf">The Millennium Development Goals Report 2011</a>).</p> <p> At a local scale, success depends on a more holistic approach to catchment management that fosters sustainable growth with food and environmental security.</p> <p>Elements include:</p> <ul class="links"> <li>Urban farming&ndash;Production systems that are biodiverse, energetically efficient, socially just and resilient. Such systems have arisen spontaneously as in the case of Cuba after the end of Soviet subsidies in 1989. Others have arisen in response to the energy and economic crises in 2008. Urban farming initiatives can provide basic subsistence while maintaining income from agricultural exports. They encourage local food production by small and family farmers based on local innovation and renewable resources. Human resource development is the cornerstone of strategies aimed at increasing options for rural people and especially resource-poor farmers (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2011.582947">The agroecological revolution in Latin America: rescuing nature, ensuring food sovereignty and empowering peasants 2011</a>).</li> <li>No-tillage farming&ndash;Weeds are controlled mainly by herbicides to reduce moisture loss/weed competition and energy costs. In this system seeds are sown into undisturbed soil, thus conserving stubble from the previous crop and reducing soil erosion as well as off&ndash;site loss of agrochemicals. No-tillage systems with crop rotation have increased yield on better agricultural land and reduced pressure on more marginal land, which largely accounts for productivity and environmental gains over the last two decades in Latin America (<a href="http://www.rolf-derpsch.com/notill.htm">No-tillage 2011</a>).</li> <li>Improving water use efficiency&ndash;Effective and efficient water management is essential as drought and floods can reduce yield. Agriculture accounts for about 70% of all water use globally. Food exports effectively transfer water across regions. However, this "safety net" is threatened by shrinking water availability for agriculture. Better irrigation scheduling offers a way forward (<a href="http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/faresa/research/Hamdhani_AWRA.pdf">Real-time soil water monitoring for optimum water management 2005</a>).</li> <li>Protecting vulnerable land and biodiversity&ndash;Adoption of voluntary standards and the promotion and better management practices along supply chains can create business opportunities that provide long-term sustainability. Consumers are often willing to pay a premium for products associated with positive biodiversity. By participating in commodity roundtables, producers and industries raise awareness and profits that benefit stakeholders and environments most at risk (<a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTENVMAT/Resources/3011350-1271279658247/Institutional2-IFC.pdf">Setting and complying with voluntary standards&mdash;A private sector approach to reducing biodiversity impacts 2009</a>).</li> <li>Preventing environmental flashpoints&ndash;Examples of agricultural-environmental &quot;flashpoints&quot; abound. However, earlier intervention and audits can raise awareness and prevent local environmental hotspots from becoming &quot;flashpoints&quot; that require expensive remediation (<a href="ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/006/y5086E/y5086E00.pdf">Guidelines for establishing audits of agricultural â€“ environmental hotspots Michael H. Glantz 2003</a>).</li> <li>Managing pest and diseases&ndash;Pests and their natural enemies do not recognize farm boundaries. Areawide pest management (AWPM) can improve both the performance of control measures while minimizing their environmental impact (<a href="http://www-naweb.iaea.org/nafa/ipc/public/Area-wide-control_1-72-Front-Cover.pdf">Area-wide pest control of fruit flies and other insect pests Part 1 2000</a>).</li> <li>Forecasting&ndash;The Pesticide Impact Rating Index (PIRI) program assesses off-site impacts of different pesticides and land uses. The presence of high impact rating pesticides in water indicates where and when to deploy mitigation strategies (<a href="http://www.clw.csiro.au/research/biogeochemistry/organics/projects/piri.html">The Pesticide Impact Rating Index</a>).</li> <li>Monitoring&ndash;Georeferenced samples help pinpoint the source and the identity of toxic constituents if both chemical and biological analyses are employed. Data from downstream and upstream reference sites provide important feed&ndash;back for land managers about management practices under local conditions.</li>

<li>Reducing off-target transport of agrochemicals&ndash;Hedgerows and conservation buffers have a long history in Europe and now elsewhere. Benefits include reduced spray drift and off-target movement of agrochemicals (<a href="http://www.wsi.nrcs.usda.gov/products/W2Q/pest/docs/newconbuf.pdf">Conservation buffers to reduce pesticide losses 2000</a>). Likewise, artificial wetlands can protect streams and waterways from sediments and agrochemicals. For example, in South Africa up to 93% of the insecticide aziphos-methyl in runoff was retained with an 89% reduction in toxicity at the outlet (<a href="http://training.fws.gov/EC/Resources/pesticides/Fate%20and%20Transport/EST35_01-Runoff.PDF">Effectiveness of a constructed wetland for retention of nonpoint-source pesticide pollution in the Lourens River catchment, South Africa 2001</a>).</li></ul>

<article id="Implementation strategies">

<h2>Implementation</h2> <p>  <a href="http://pubs.iied.org/16514SIIED.html">Overarching national strategies such as payments for environmental services</a> achieves outcomes when combined with sound catchment management that define roles and responsibilities. Tools such as remote sensing and high resolution mass spectrometry help pin&ndash;point priority catchments. However, implementation is driven by objective monitoring data that enables land managers to demonstrate compliance with standards and a cycle of continuous improvement. This requires local support and data. In practice, change starts upstream by monitoring microcatchments where land-use and waterways are closely coupled and low cost techniques such as bioindicators are applicable. Successful strategies then self&ndash;replicated downstream by local &quot;champions&quot;.</p> <p>In essence, sustainable catchment management is a convergence of overarching national policy, economic drivers and more creative ways to foster local human development (<a href="iupac_brazil_eacb_abstract_Rev4.pdf"> Accelerated capacity building and networking resources 2009</a>).</p>
